# Portfolio : Project 1 : Online Retail Ecommerce Dataset

This project is based on a publicly available dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing real transactional data from a UK-based online retail company. The data spans from December 2010 to December 2011 and includes information on customer purchases of unique gift items. The project focuses on applying data engineering techniques to clean, transform, and extract insights from the dataset, simulating real-world e-commerce data processes.
