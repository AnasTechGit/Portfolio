# Portfolio : Project 1 : Online Retail Ecommerce Dataset

This project is based on a publicly available dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing real transactional data from a UK-based online retail company. The data spans from December 2010 to December 2011 and includes information on customer purchases of unique gift items. 
The project focuses on applying data engineering techniques to clean, transform, and extract insights from the dataset, simulating real-world e-commerce data processes.

Here are the columns present in the dataset:

InvoiceNo – Invoice number identifying each transaction
StockCode – Unique code representing each product
Description – Detailed description of the product
Quantity – Number of units purchased for each product
InvoiceDate – Date and time when the transaction was recorded
UnitPrice – Price per unit of the product (in GBP)
CustomerID – Unique identifier for each customer
Country – Country where the customer is located
